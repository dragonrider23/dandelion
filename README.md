Dandelion
=============
Dandelion is a web-based entry log application.

Requirements
-------------

* Apache Web Server 2
* PHP >= 5

Notes
------------

This is version 3.1 and for the time being had the feature set in place. I'm currently working on cleaning up the code and adding database driven category management (instead of the horrendious (sp) categories.js script).
