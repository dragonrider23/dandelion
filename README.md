Dandelion
=============
Dandelion is a web-based entry log application.

Requirements
-------------

* Apache >= 2.2
* PHP >= 5

Notes
------------

This is version 3.1 and for the time being has the feature set in place. I'm currently working on cleaning up the code and adding database driven category management (instead of the horrendious (sp) categories.js script).
